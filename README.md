# Blog-Website

This is a working blog website.
NOTE: create a folder named "images" in the assets folder to store the inmages.

This website has been created using HTML, CSS & PHP.
For the backend it uses MySQL.

For easy integration of the project use Xampp since it has all the required Modules, such as:
Apache, MySQL etc.

Turn on Apache and MySQL.

I have added the .sql file for the website. Use it to import it in ur phpmyadmin.
